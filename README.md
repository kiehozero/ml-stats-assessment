# Machine Learning and Statistics Assessment Repository
Repository for the assessment in ATU Machine Learning and Statistics

From introduction: "Project • The project is to create a notebook exploring classification algorithms applied on the iris flower data set associated with Ronald A. Fisher
• In your notebook, you should first explain what supervised learning is and then explain what classification algorithms are.
• Describe at least one common classification algorithm and implement it using the scikit-learn Python library.
• Throughout your notebook, use appropriate plots, mathematical notation, and diagrams to explain the relevant concepts."
