In this task, you should write a function `sqrt(x)` to approximate the square root of a floating-point number $x$ without using either the power operator or a package such as `math`. Start with an initial guess for the square root called $z_0$. You then repeatedly improve it using the following formula, until the difference between some previous guess $z_i$ and the next $z_{i+1}$ is less than some threshold, say 0.01.\n",
